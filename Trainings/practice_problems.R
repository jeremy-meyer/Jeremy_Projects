# Example Problems

# Create and store a vector of numbers from 1 to 100. Multiply each value by 5


# Remove the 10th element from the above vector


# Load in a dataset called mtcars (should be already stored). Print all rows with mpg<15. 
# How many rows are there?


# Write a for loop / conditional to print out all even numbers between 1-50


# Use for loops to print all pairs of integers that multiply to get 60.


# Write a coin flip function that returns "H" or "T" with 50 % probability


# To check your function, plot a basic histogram of the total number of heads/tails
# after running your function 1000 times.


# Create a simulation to determine the approximate probability of flipping 
# exactly 6 heads out of 20 flips. 


# (Harder) Suppose that you flip 100 coins. Create a simulation and determine
# an approximate probability of flipping 5+ heads in a row somewhere within the 100 flips? 
# 8+ in a row?
