# Example Problems

# 1. Create and store a vector of numbers from 1 to 100. Multiply each value by 5


# 2. Remove the 10th element from the above vector


# 3. Load in a dataframe called mtcars (should be already stored). Print all rows with mpg<15. 
# How many rows are there?


# 4. What is the average mpg value for each gear value (3,4,5)?


# 5 Make a basic plot between the mpg and hoursepower (hp) values in mtcars.
# What is the correlation? Is this expected?


# 6. Write a for loop / conditional to print out all even numbers between 1-50


# 7. Use for loops to print all pairs of integers that multiply to get 60.


# 8. Write a coin flip function that returns "H" or "T" with 50% probability


# 9. To check your function, plot a basic histogram of the total number of heads/tails
# after running your function 1000 times.


# 10. Create a simulation to determine the approximate probability of flipping
# exactly 6 heads out of 20 flips.


# 11. (Harder) Suppose that you flip 100 coins. Create a simulation and determine
# an approximate probability of flipping consecutive 5+ heads somewhere within the 100 flip sequence? 
# What about 8+ in a row?
