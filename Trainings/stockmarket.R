
# Suppose the prices in a stock market can be modeled by S = So * e ^ (u + sigma*Z)
# Where:
# S  = price of current day
# So = Price of previous day
# u  = .002 (fixed)
# sig = .03 (fixed)
# Z ~ Random Normal(0,1) (use rnorm)

# Write a function that takes a starting value, parameter u, parameter sigma, and t = number of days to simulate
# Part a ------------------------------------------------



# Let's say the stock starts at So=100, and you're interested in the price after 90 days
# Plot one (or a few) simulated stocks in one graph (use lines() to do multiple plots)
# Part b ------------------------------------------------




# If you have to sell after 90 days, would this be a worthwile investment?
# (Hint: Simulate stock time series prices for 90 days and take the last one 10000 times)
# Part c ------------------------------------------------



# Plot a histogram of the possible values of the stock after 90 days. 
# Part d ------------------------------------------------
