# Hi there :D
Welcome to my github! My name is Jeremy Meyer and here's some of the code and projects I've been doing. Feel free to ask me about any of it. 

# Personal Projects
Includes:
- Some work code from vivint along with my code from image processing tutorials (mostly python)
- Some School code from statistics classes (mostly R)
- And most importantly, some fun, original projects I'm working on (like a monopoly simulation).
